The password is hidden in an unknown file, and Sam has set up a script to display a calendar. Requirements: Basic UNIX command knowledge.

This time Network Security sam has saved the unencrypted level7 password in an obscurely named file saved in this very directory.

In other unrelated news, Sam has set up a script that returns the output from the UNIX cal command. Here is the script:

Enter the year you wish to view and hit 'view'.

req: terminal commands
metd: reach the file, validate the password

Dissecting the scenario: Sam has broken the calender command into two parts. The value entered by user is passed through the cal command, which displays the calender. Sam missed that in terminal, we can stack up multiple commands by using ; or & or &&. The hint says there is a file where the password is stored, we simply pass ls for directory listing. 

Output: 

index.php
level7.php
cal.pl
.
..
k1kh31b1n55h.php

We check k1kh31b1n55h.php file from the browser so /k1kh31b1n55h.php: 62832940

The password is yet again hidden in an unknown file. Sam's daughter has begun learning PHP, and has a small script to demonstrate her knowledge. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI (dynamic html executed by the server, rather than the browser)

Sam remains confident that an obscured password file is still the best idea, but he screwed up with the calendar program. Sam has saved the unencrypted password file in /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/8/

However, Sam's young daughter Stephanie has just learned to program in PHP. She's talented for her age, but she knows nothing about security. She recently learned about saving files, and she wrote a script to demonstrate her ability.

req: SSI
metd: SSI

So the simple command that does that is <!--#exec cmd="ls" --> 
Which gives us a directory listing of inside the /tmp/ directory. To proceed one level up, simply <!--#exec cmd="ls ../" --> ls one directory up

Output: au12ha39vc.php index.php level8.php tmp! Check the file via browser: 569c6328

Password: 569c6328. Attempt: 1 Success: 1
