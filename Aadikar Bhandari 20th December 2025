Basic test of your skills to see if you can do any of these missions. Requirements: HTML

Level 1(the idiot test)
This level is what we call "The Idiot Test", if you can't complete it, don't give up on learning all you can, but, don't go begging to someone else for the answer, thats one way to get you hated/made fun of. Enter the password and you can continue.

req: HTML- hypertext markup language; the framework for making websites. 
obj> scan source code, learn how the website works, trace flaws

metd: Ctrl +U to view the source code

Commented line 176: <!-- the first few levels are extremely easy: password is 6ea054e2 -->

HTML comment: Not displayed to the user, might contain hidden information

password attempt: 1 success: 1

Basic 2

A slightly more difficult challenge, involving an incomplete password script. Requirements: Common sense.

Network Security Sam set up a password protection script. He made it load the real password from an unencrypted text file and compare it to the password the user enters. However, he neglected to upload the password file...

obj> scan source code, find logic flaw, exploit it

Source code check: No user side scripts- script would be server side and hidden, No password files. Script matches password file with user command. Password is missing, hence returns null. To match, we should input null value, which is empty.

Password: Null. Password attempt: 1 success: 1

Basic 3

Some intuition is needed to find the location of the hidden password file. Requirements: Basic HTML knowledge

This time Network Security Sam remembered to upload the password file, but there were deeper problems than that.

obj: scan the source code, find flaws to exploit

Line 174:  <input type="hidden" name="file" value="password.php" />
Password.php looks like a file name. Checking the file. File content: ba03ccec

The input value is matched against the string stored in the file: passport.php. Hence, entering the value stored in the file should lead to an exact match.

Password: ba03ccec. Password attempt: 1 success: 1

Basic 4

An email script has been set up, which sends the password to the administrator. Requirements: HTML knowledge, an email address

obj: scan the source code, learn the mechanism and modify it

This time Sam hardcoded the password into the script. However, the password is long and complex, and Sam is often forgetful. So he wrote a script that would email his password to him automatically in case he forgot. Here is the script:

Line 174:    <input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org" /><input type="submit" value="Send password to Sam" /></form></center><br /><br /><center><b>Password:</b><br />

Attempting modification of "to" value from sam's email to a different one. Ctrl Shift + C to launch inspect, modify successful. Send password to sam

Password reminder successfully sent to
(Note: If this is not the email address on your HackThisSite profile, no email will actually be sent.)

Utilizing hint: adding the email used for the profile, checking mail: 8ca5a306

Password: 8ca5a306. Password attempt: 1 Success: 1

Basic  5

Similar to the previous challenge, but with some extra security measures in place. Requirements: HTML knowledge, JS or FF, an email address.

Sam has gotten wise to all the people who wrote their own forms to get the password. Rather than actually learn the password, he decided to make his email program a little more secure.

obj: scan the source code, figure out the email program, find an exploit

Launch inspector, Ctrl Shift +J, replace sam's email with the registered email. Send password to Sam
Checking mail: 68e80a15

Password: 68e80a15. Attempt: 1 Success: 1
