Basic 7

The password is hidden in an unknown file, and Sam has set up a script to display a calendar. Requirements: Basic UNIX command knowledge.

This time Network Security sam has saved the unencrypted level7 password in an obscurely named file saved in this very directory.

In other unrelated news, Sam has set up a script that returns the output from the UNIX cal command. Here is the script:

Enter the year you wish to view and hit 'view'.

req: terminal commands
metd: reach the file, validate the password

Dissecting the scenario: Sam has broken the calender command into two parts. The value entered by user is passed through the cal command, which displays the calender. Sam missed that in terminal, we can stack up multiple commands by using ; or & or &&. The hint says there is a file where the password is stored, we simply pass ls for directory listing. 

Output: 

index.php
level7.php
cal.pl
.
..
k1kh31b1n55h.php

We check k1kh31b1n55h.php file from the browser so /k1kh31b1n55h.php: 62832940

Password: f866d6b9. Attempt: 1 Success:1

The password is yet again hidden in an unknown file. Sam's daughter has begun learning PHP, and has a small script to demonstrate her knowledge. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI (dynamic html executed by the server, rather than the browser)

Sam remains confident that an obscured password file is still the best idea, but he screwed up with the calendar program. Sam has saved the unencrypted password file in /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/8/

However, Sam's young daughter Stephanie has just learned to program in PHP. She's talented for her age, but she knows nothing about security. She recently learned about saving files, and she wrote a script to demonstrate her ability.

req: SSI
metd: SSI

So the simple command that does that is <!--#exec cmd="ls" --> Basically, the instruction for server is to execute the ls command.

Which gives us a directory listing of inside the /tmp/ directory. To proceed one level up, simply <!--#exec cmd="ls ../" --> ls one directory up

Output: au12ha39vc.php index.php level8.php tmp! Check the file via browser: 569c6328

Password: 569c6328. Attempt: 1 Success: 1

Basic 9

The password is again hidden in an unknown file. However, the script that was previously used to find it has some limitations. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI, unix directory structure.


Network Security Sam is going down with the ship - he's determined to keep obscuring the password file, no matter how many times people manage to recover it. This time the file is saved in /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/9/.

In the last level, however, in my attempt to limit people to using server side includes to display the directory listing to level 8 only, I have mistakenly screwed up somewhere.. there is a way to get the obscured level 9 password. See if you can figure out how...

This level seems a lot trickier then it actually is, and it helps to have an understanding of how the script validates the user's input. The script finds the first occurance of '<--', and looks to see what follows directly after it.

metd: Get to level 8, <!--#exec cmd="ls ../../9/" --> Starting inside the root/8/tmp/ folder first ../ leads us to /8/ and the second ../ leads us to root then we enter 9/ and run a directory listing on that directory. so it'll run ls on root/9/

Output: index.php p91e283zc3.php
The file contains: 92e98ec9

Password:92e98ec9. Attempt: 1 Success: 1

This time Sam used a more temporary and "hidden" approach to authenticating users, but he didn't think about whether or not those users knew their way around javascript...

Enter password
Please enter a password to gain access to level 10

req: JS

Let's start with scan of source code, nothing there not very surprising. Let's inspect Ctrl Shift +J to look at what's happening, particularly on the Application tab.

There is a cookie level10_authorized with it's value set to no. Modify value to yes. And submit. The password isn't requried here, we simply authorize the session via the cookie.

Password: null. Attempts: 1 Success: 1

Sam decided to make a music site. Unfortunately he does not understand Apache. This mission is a bit harder than the other basics.

I love my music! "Empty Sky" is the best!

Interesting observation to add: What to do here? Usually there was a text field to enter password, however, in this one, no such file. Let's check if index.php exists based on previous understanding of the challenges.

Enter correct password:

Okay, we have a field to enter password now. 

Let's check source code of the homepage and this page.

First checking the source code: <!--We even have our own collection - if you could find it!--> interesting comment right there.
